Hi there , 
Are you a big fan of cats? 
I cannot say that I am 4 years ago but now I am a loyal cat slave.
I grew up with dogs and have been in love with dogs my whole life. 
My best friend, Khun nin a cocker spaniel, was 12 when she passed away.
She used to get beaten often by random stray cats who passed by my place. 
Khun nin was not happy with cats, certainly I was not very impressed with cats as well.
